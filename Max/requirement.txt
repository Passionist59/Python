1st milestone- Bug fixing for the payment integration and contact management features developed already.
2nd milestone- Notification/alerts feature implementation
3nd milestone- adding new question type for creating surveys along with report
4th milestone- fix the bugs developed for milestone- 3 & 4...

You would get two repo access, one is RightSurvey - Application access 
and other one is RightPayment - Its payment backend application.
